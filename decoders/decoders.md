# Decoders

Extension: Aug 26 -> Sep 30

Seven weeks.

Codes:

- [This week] Finish LP codes + Bivariate bicycle (BB) code

Decoders:

- [2 weeks] BP-OSD, whose performance will be compared with `ldpc_v2`. It seems that we do not have a usable version for now.
- [2 week] Small-set flip. https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-432/
- [or something else?, 1 week] BP-LSD, as in `ldpc_v2`.

> BP+LSD: Belief propagation plus localised statistics decoding. A parallel decoding algorithm that matches the perforance of BP+OSD. Note that the version implemented currenlty runs in serial. We are working on the parallel version! See our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18655
